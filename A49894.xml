            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THERE is no neceſſity I ſhould take upon me to ſet forth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of thoſe Tracts, wherein the Hiſtory of Mankind is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into a narrow compaſs; the vaſt number of ſuch ſort of Books, which have been publiſh'd by learned Men, eſpecially from the Time when good Literature has begun to revive in theſe our Weſtern Parts, doth ſufficiently evidence the Sentiments of the learned World in this matter: Theſe are the only Two things that can be required at my hands; firſt, why I choſe rather to project a New Method of<pb facs="tcp:55008:3"/>my own, than make uſe of others Induſtry, after the labours of ſo many learned Men that are ſtill extant; and then to ſhew the Reaſon of my Deſign: Both which I ſhall diſpatch in a few words.</p>
            <p>In the Courſe of my Studies, I could not but obſerve, that moſt of theſe ſorts of <hi>Epitomes</hi> were either too long or too ſhort; ſo that there was a Deficiency in both, that obſtructed the Reader from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the benefit he hoped for, in the peruſal of them; for they are written to the intent they may be frequently turned over by the Studious, and almoſt retained in their memories; which cannot be, if they are of the larger ſize: For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſuch Works as theſe, is, That the Times wherein the moſt remarkable Events that have happened among all Nations, may be notified, and that the Chronology of them, compared one with another, may be revolved upon; ſo that who were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries among the remoteſt Nations, and what things fell out in the ſame Age,<pb facs="tcp:55008:3"/>may be eaſily produced: But this cannot be done, if your Hiſtorical <hi>Compendiums</hi> be too ſhort, of which there are very many, in which the Chronology is too ſummarily comprehended.</p>
            <p>Both theſe faults we have endeavoured to ſhun herein, and therefore we have followed <hi>Dionyſius Petavius,</hi> the moſt accurate of Chronologers, in this our <hi>Epitome,</hi> till the Year of our Lord, <hi>533.</hi> to which he brought down his Annals. Not that we look upon him to have been wholly free from error, in ſo perplex'd a thing, and that admits of ſo much variety; nay, we have noted ſome here: But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he is leſs guilty than thoſe who have wrote before him; neither are they raſhly to be called Faults, that oppoſe ſome Conjectures, wherewith Chronologers do now a-days abound.</p>
            <p>What was chiefly wanting in thoſe <hi>Epitomes</hi> that are already extant, and for the amending whereof we have applied our ſelves, in this our <hi>COMPENDIUM,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55008:4"/>we have taken to be theſe things:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> A truer, though ſhort Narration of many things, which were not very aptly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the days of our Anceſtors, ſuch as thoſe Matters that are boaſted of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Four Monarchies, and many others:</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> A pointing to ſeveral Modern Writers, from whom a fuller knowledge may be had of ſeveral things, which we have briefly mention'd:</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>3.</hi> A more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate and truer expounding of many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars relating to the Holy Scriptures, and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, than is found elſewhere.</item>
               </list> Moſt Writers have, as it were, combined, in every thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and approve of thoſe who have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their Deſigns; when, on the contrary, they have moſtly condemned others, and laden them with Reproaches, who have had the misfortune to be born down with the number of Voices; as if proſperous Events, and the multitude of Conſents, were infallible arguments of Truth; or that whoever were commended<pb facs="tcp:55008:4"/>in Ancient Times, were worthy of Praiſes; as thoſe who were condemned, ſhould be really guilty: But herein we neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve nor condemn any Man, ſaving that the thing it ſelf does clearly abſolve or condemn them; and, for the moſt part, we have alſo barely declared the thing as it was, without making any enquiry what Opinions were true or falſe, but what really happened, and actually came to paſs.</p>

            <p>This our <hi>Compendium</hi> is diſtinguiſhed into twelve <hi>Epochs,</hi> and therein we take in whatever has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from the beginning of the World, to the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great: For here an end ought to be put to Ancient Hiſtory; for about theſe times it was, that the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy'd, and new Kingdoms ſet up both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Epoch</hi> ſhall be the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> which, according to the Computation of <hi>Dionyſius Petavius,</hi> whom we ſhall follow for the future, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the year before Chriſt 3984. From hence to the Deluge, will be comprehended an Hiſtory of 1656 years, for it was in that year of the World the Univerſal Deluge hapned, before our Saviour's Birth 2328.</p>
            <p>The Second ſhall be <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, from whence to the calling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which hapned in the year of the World 2022, before Chriſt 1962, are computed 366 years.</p>
            <p>The Third ſhall be taken from the calling of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> to the time of the <hi>Law given by Moſes,</hi> which we referr to the year of the World 2453, before Chriſt 1531, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends 431 years.</p>
            <p>The Fourth commences from the time of <hi>the Law given by Moſes,</hi> from whence to the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> we reckon 347 years, in the year of the World 2800, before Chriſt 1184.</p>
            <p>The Fifth is the <hi>Deſtruction of Troy,</hi> from whence to the building of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55008:6"/>was effected <hi>An. M.</hi> 2992, before Chriſt 992, are comprehended 192 years.</p>
            <p>The ſixth is the <hi>Building of the Temple at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> by <hi>Solomon,</hi> which was 216 years before the firſt <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which is computed to fall in the year of the World 3208, before Chriſt 776.</p>
            <p>The Seventh is taken from the <hi>firſt Olympiad,</hi> from whence are reckoned 238 years, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity,</hi> that hapned <hi>An. M.</hi> 3446, before Chriſt 538.</p>
            <p>The Eighth is the <hi>Freeing of the Jews from the Babyloniſh Captivity</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which fell out 336 years before <hi>Carthage</hi> was overcome by <hi>Scipio. An. M.</hi> 3782, before Chriſt 202.</p>

               <p>Then Mankind began to Build the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> to preſerve them a Name among Poſterity, and about which they might fix their Habitations, leaſt they ſhould be ſcattered over the face of the Earth; But through Diſcord, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated into different Regions, and it came to paſs in proceſs of time, that the Original Language underwent various changes among a People that were ſo remote from one another. Of this you may ſee what we have writ in our Philological Comment upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>The Poſterity of <hi>Sem</hi> fixed their Seats in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Aſia;</hi> of <hi>Cham</hi> partly in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and partly in <hi>Africa;</hi> and of <hi>Japheth</hi> in the leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> See <hi>Gen. c.</hi> 10. as alſo the forecited <hi>Bochar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after the firſt Diſcipation of Mankind, <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Son of <hi>Chus,</hi> who in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> is called <hi>Bar-Chus,</hi> whence the name of <hi>Bacchus</hi> amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> began to ſettle his Empire in <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia;</hi> the beginning of whoſe Kingdom were <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Ezech, Chalne</hi> and <hi>Acchad</hi> in the Land of <hi>Sinaar,</hi> that is, <hi>Babylon;</hi> from whence he went out into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and built <hi>Nineve,</hi> Rechoboth, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach,<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55008:8"/>and <hi>Roſen,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.10, 11. by which words is only meant, that he laid the Foundation of thoſe Cities, which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo called; for <hi>Nineve</hi> was ſo named ſome ages after by <hi>Ninus.</hi> See <hi>Bochartus</hi> his <hi>Phaleg, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>But whether the Kingdom deſcended from this firſt King to his Poſterity, is uncertain. <hi>Africanus</hi> doth indeed recite the Names of ſeven <hi>Chaldean</hi> Kings, and ſix <hi>Arabian,</hi> that Reigned in <hi>Babylon;</hi> but theſe are clearly different from thoſe which ſome have produced out of <hi>Cteſia.</hi> The firſt that <hi>Africanus</hi> has, is called <hi>Evechous,</hi> but that in <hi>Cteſia</hi> is <hi>Belus;</hi> and therefore all theſe are to be reckoned amongſt the obſcure number. See <hi>Iſ. Voſſius</hi> and <hi>Dion. Petavius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Kingdoms were in thoſe times very ſmall; and what has been uſually ſaid of that great Empire of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe bounds were extended by <hi>Ninus</hi> the Son of <hi>Belus,</hi> who is thought to have been <hi>Nimrod,</hi> through all the greater <hi>Aſia,</hi> is a meer Fable. The Earth in thoſe days, was in a manner incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred every where with Trees, and inhabited ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by wild Beaſts than Men.</p>
               <p>A little after began the <hi>Egyptian Dynaſties,</hi> which were in number four, the <hi>Theban, Thinitican, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitican</hi> and <hi>Tanitican Dynaſties,</hi> whoſe reſpective Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Cities were <hi>Thebes, This,</hi> and <hi>Memphis</hi> in the Higher <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Tanis</hi> ſeated in that part of the Country called the Lower <hi>Egypt;</hi> but the firſt that ſeems to have poſſeſt all <hi>Egypt</hi> was <hi>Menes,</hi> the firſt King in each Dynaſty. He ſeems to have been the ſame with <hi>Cham, Noah</hi>'s Son. Sir <hi>John Marſham</hi> has a Catalogue of his Succeſſors. <hi>Sec.</hi> 1. and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55008:9"/>who is to be conſulted with, concerning the Antiquities of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About theſe times <hi>Fohi</hi> ſeems to have flouriſhed as firſt Emperor of <hi>China,</hi> though their Calculation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which we follow, and doth better accord with the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint, but wherein the error lies, who can tell? See <hi>Iſ. Voſſius de Aetate Mundi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Scicyone</hi> in the <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> is thought to have had its beginning not long after, whereof <hi>Aegialeus</hi> was the firſt King, who is placed by Chronologers about theſe times. See <hi>Petavius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arts ſeemed to have flouriſhed about the end of this Period, and Architecture was now firſt known, becauſe certain <hi>Pyramids</hi> of a Stupendious bigneſs and height are thought to have been built at this time in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but ſeeing the beginning of all Ancient Hiſtory commences here, we have commonly no more than the Names of Kings and Patriarchs, and Fables beyond.</p>
               <p>At this very time, Idolatry ſeems to have ſprung up in the World, ſeeing before now, all Mankind worſhipped one only God. And this was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thereof. Men knew that there were certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Eſſences, which were called Angels, beſides the Supream God, whom the Almighty ſent as his Legates or Embaſſadors, and if I may ſay ſo, as it were, leſſer Gods, unto Men. Theſe, Mankind at firſt worſhipped as Gods Embaſſadors; as we ſee the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themſelves held them in great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But when they once fell into that Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Supream God committed Empires, Cities and Families to the care of theſe leſſer ones, they grew by degrees, almoſt forgetful of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55008:9"/>Deity, and ſhewed that Reverence to thoſe leſſer Gods, that was due to him alone. Then they fell into an opinion, that the Souls of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Men, after their deceaſe, were admitted into the Order of thoſe leſſer Deities; and hence it came to paſs, that Deceaſed Kings were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, as if they had been taken into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gods. All which however did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that that Ancient and True Opinion ſtill Survived amongſt moſt Nations, that there was a Supream God, and that it was upon him alone, that the reſt of the Inferior Deities had their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>Moreover, becauſe Angels ſometimes delivered Oracles in Statues, as <hi>John Spencer</hi> concerning <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummin,</hi> prettily conjectures, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens erected Statues to their Gods. And it ſhould ſeem afterwards to have come to paſs, that when both the Worſhip and Manners of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Angels of Light, becauſe they ſaw many put them up in the place of the Creator, they forſook them; and the Angels of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſucceeded in their places, whence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays, the Heathens worſhipped Devils; not that the Heathens did believe they adored Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which we call Devils; but becauſe their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Statues were only inhabited by Devils. But the diſcuſſion of theſe things require a larger Volume.</p>

               <p>IDolatry being now grown prevalent in the World, God was pleaſed to make choice of ſome Family, from among the reſt of Mankind, wherein the Knowledge and Worſhip of one only Supream God might be kept up; and therefore he called <hi>Abraham</hi> one of the Poſterity of <hi>Sem,</hi> out of <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and commanded him to go into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where he made himſelf oftner, and more clearly known unto him by the Miniſtry of Angels; and eſpecially gave him that Signal promiſe, that it ſhould ſome time come to paſs, that one of his Poſterity ſhould bring the Bleſſings of Heaven unto all Nations.</p>

               <p>VVHEN the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the lower <hi>Egypt</hi> for 217 years, and ſuffered a cruel Bondage under the Kings of that part of the Country, who by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are called <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and took away that Country from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they were at length after the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divers Miracles, freed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Scriptures declare.</p>
               <p>They increaſed to a vaſt Multitude in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſeeing there were ſix hundred thouſand Men able to bear Arms, that went out of the Country, from whence we may gather that they amounted in all at leaſt to two Millions of Souls. Theſe paſſed the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> in one Night, which by the following method, might be done in the ſpace of eight hours; let us ſuppoſe that the ſpace of the Sea ſo divided to each ſide as it was, might contain an Army, whoſe front conſiſted of two hundred Men, that is, about two hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces broad; and let us ſuppoſe that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all that ſpace, ſo that the front of the Army or Multitude, conſiſted of two Hundred; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55008:13"/>let us grant that the Chanel of the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> contained in breadth, the ſpace of two hours paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over, ſo that 120000 Men might be contained in the Chanel of the Sea ſo long and ſo broad, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in a Body, whoſe front was made up of two hundred Men. Which Notion carries nothing of abſurdity in it; ſeeing every one at leaſt is allowed a pace ſquare, for ſix thouſand Paces takes in at leaſt two hours Journey, which if multiplyed by 200, which was the breadth allowed for the dryed ſpace, this will make up 120000 paces ſquare. Hence 'tis manifeſt, that the firſt Rank of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, might reach the oppoſite Shoar in two hours time; and that Body which followed the ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men two hours after; by which method 120000 Men might paſs through that Sea in four hours. Now let us allow the other four hours for the reſt of the People, and all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might paſs over in the ſpace of eight hours. But it is to be noted, that the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> might have been nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, and the ſpace from whence the waters were driven, larger; from whence it follows, that that paſſage throught, might have been done in leſs time than we have aſſigned.</p>
               <p>It ſeems wonderful, that ſuch a vaſt number of People could be contained in the lower <hi>Egypt;</hi> but the wonder will be leſſen'd to him that conſiders how populous and fertil <hi>Egypt</hi> was of Old. Concerning which conſult <hi>J. Voſſius obſerv. var. c.</hi> 10. Neither could there be any danger in the Opinion, though we were to grant, that the Copyers or Tranſcribers might through neglect miſtake in the number, ſo as that they are ſometimes found in our Books, to be more than really they were. But of this we<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55008:13"/>ſhall ſpeak elſewhere. After they had paſſed dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhod through the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> they lived forty years in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where what befell them is contained in <hi>Exodas, Leviticus, Numbers</hi> and <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy.</hi> There it was more eſpecially that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Law, which comprehended three ſorts of Precepts. The firſt related to good Manners, and were common to all Mankind alike; others related to Sacred Rites; and the third were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the Government of Civil Society.</p>
               <p>The Moral Precepts were approved of by all Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Nations, and every Wife Man; as to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, there are ſeveral of them taken from thoſe of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which God eſtabliſhed by a Law, becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were already uſed to them; thoſe being rectified which might be faulty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which you may conſult the Famous <hi>J.

Petyte,</hi> have obſerved; which laſt has made a Collection of them; becauſe, that as <hi>Cecrops</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Athens,</hi> being an <hi>Egyptian</hi> born, brought his own Country Laws into the Country of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> by God's Command, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> having been uſed to the Laws of <hi>Egypt,</hi> commanded many Precepts out of them, though he added many particular ones: But above all others, this was peculiar to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that God was the chief Magiſtrate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and that there was no name of any other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, could agree with it; ſo that a new one was to be invented, which they called a <hi>Theocracy.</hi>

               <p>This ſame year, upon the Abrogating of the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentian Law,</hi> concerning the <hi>Quinqueviri,</hi> there were three Embaſſadors ſent into <hi>Greece,</hi> to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into the Laws of that Country, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally into thoſe of <hi>Athens,</hi> that they might amend the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws by them. Upon the return of the Embaſſadors, which was three years after, the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> of the People and Conſuls were laid aſide, and the <hi>Decemviri</hi> conſtituted, to ſet down the Laws of the Common-wealth, who were the firſt that reduced the ſame into ten Tables, which by the addition of two more to them afterwards, made up thoſe Famous twelve Tables, which were the foundation of the whole Body of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Laws.</p>
               <p>After the Republick had for the ſpace of two years or a little more, been Governed by this ſort of Magiſtracy, it reverted to its Ancient form upon<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55008:32"/>this occaſion. As the <hi>Decemviri</hi> demeaned themſelves but indifferently in their charge, and that <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> had made <hi>Virginia</hi> a free Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Slave, out of the hopes he had to enjoy her, her Father <hi>Virginius</hi> Slew him, made the People Mutiny, and brought things ſo to bear, that the Office of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> was Abrogated, and Tributes of the People and Conſuls were choſen again.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were doing in <hi>Rome, Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> returning from <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> together with <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe, Rectified the corrupt manners of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and preſſed upon them the obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this time it was, that the <hi>Jews</hi> began to gather the Books of Scripture together into one Volume, which is the ſame we have at this day. But ſeeing that the <hi>Jews</hi> during the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, had almoſt forgot the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, and way of Writing, the Ancient Books were written in <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Characters, and what was read in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Tongue in the Scriptures, was expounded to the People in the <hi>Chaldee;</hi> See <hi>Lud. Capellus</hi> concerning the <hi>Hebrew</hi> letters. But the <hi>Samaritans</hi> when they received <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, before the <hi>Phoenician</hi> or Ancient Character was grown quite obſolete, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them; from whence it comes to paſs, that the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which was written in the Ancient Letters, is ſo handed down to us.

                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> being overthrown ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but more particularly by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Cimon,</hi> was forced to make a Diſhonourable Peace with them, upon theſe conditions amongſt others; that he ſhould be oblig'd to leave the <hi>Maritime</hi> Cities of <hi>Aſia</hi> free; that he ſhould not come nearer to the Sea, than the ſpace of ground that a Horſe could run over without ſtopping; and that he ſhould not be carryed in a Ship, between the <hi>Cyamean</hi> and <hi>Chelidonean</hi> Iſlands.</p>
               <p>While the <hi>Athenians</hi> were overcoming the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, they procured to themſelves the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of their Neighbours, and eſpecially of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians;</hi> from whence breaking out into an open War; the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were often worſted in Battle by <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Tolmides,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; At laſt both ſides agreed to a Truce of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, which neither kept.</p>

               <p>About theſe times, <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> fled from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Ptolemy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who made him Keeper of his Library, which was very great.

               <p>When the <hi>Tarentines</hi> had firſt pillaged the <hi>Romans</hi> Ships, and evil intreated the Embaſſadors that had been ſent to them to complain of the Wrong, they made War upon them; wherein they were at firſt overthrown in a great Battel, by the <hi>Romans.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Becauſe we have made mention of this War, we will briefly recount the chief Events thereof, without the interfering of other things: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore next year, <hi>Man. Valerius Maximus</hi> and <hi>Man. Ottacilius</hi> being Conſuls, they ſailed into <hi>Sicily,</hi> as the Conſuls of the ſucceeding years did, who won divers Victories over the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> The <hi>Romans,</hi> who knew nothing hitherto of Maritine Affairs, did, in the fourth year of the War, ſet out a Fleet; and the year following, under the auſpicious Conduct of <hi>C. Dulius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, overcame the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in a Sea-Fight, though they were very skilful in Maritime Affairs, as they did often alſo in the ſucceeding years, tho' they underwent divers Shipwracks.</p>
               <p>In the ninth year of the War, after the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> had to no purpoſe oppoſed their Fleet of Three hundred and fifty Ships, againſt that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> conſiſting of Three hundred and thirty, which was Commanded by <hi>M. Attilius Regulus,</hi> they could not hinder the <hi>Roman</hi> Army to make now their firſt Deſcent into <hi>Africa. Regulus,</hi> in the beginning, performed many things very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully; but next year he was overcome and taken by <hi>Xantippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian.</hi> This Man's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is very admirable, who when he was taken and ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to treat about the Redemption of Priſoners, but ſuppoſing at the ſame time that the thing was a Diſhonour to the Commonwealth, he diſſwaded the Senate from it, and returned into <hi>Africa;</hi> where, if we believe<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55008:42"/>
                  <hi>Appian,</hi> he was cruelly put to death by the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> in a Cave full of Iron Spikes: But <hi>Jac. Palmerius</hi> upon <hi>Appian</hi> ſhews that this ſort of Death is fabulous.</p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>Romans</hi> being worſted in divers Naval Fights, and leſſened by Shipwracks, were for ſome years compelled to yield the Dominion of the Seas to the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> but in the three and twentieth year of the War, having repaired their Fleet, they beat the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> near <hi>Agates,</hi> an Iſland on the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt, under the Conduct of <hi>Q. Lutatius</hi> the Conſul; and next year, which was the twenty fourth, they granted Peace to the <hi>Carthaeginians,</hi> upon hard Conditions.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this War, <hi>Eumenes,</hi> after <hi>Phileterus,</hi> held the Principality of <hi>Pergamus</hi> in <hi>Aſia;</hi> and <hi>Nicomedes</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia</hi> gave the Name of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> to the enlarged City of <hi>Aſtacus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Republick of <hi>Achaia</hi> began to flouriſh about the middle of this War: About thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, divers Cities of <hi>Achaia</hi> entring into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, gave beginning thereunto, and entruſted the ſame to be adminiſtred by two Praetors, that were choſen ſoon after. But afterwards the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power was devolved upon one; and the firſt that exerciſed that Charge alone, was <hi>M. Cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis,</hi> who after four years time was ſucceeded by <hi>Aratus</hi> of <hi>Sicyone,</hi> who though but twenty years of age, brought his Country to enter into a Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with the other Cities of <hi>Achaia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between the firſt and ſecond Punick War, Learning began to be cultivated at <hi>Rome. Livius Andronicus</hi> was the firſt that wrote Fables; who for his Contemporaries had <hi>Ennius, Pacuvius, Nae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:55008:43"/>and other Poets given to promote the Art in their Mother-Tongue.</p>

               <p>There are no Remains left, to ſhew whether at <hi>Rome,</hi> or where elſe, the Second Epiſtle of <hi>Peter</hi> was written. <hi>Hugo Grotius, Salmaſius,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> think it to be none of his. The Firſt is ſaid to be written from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and by <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Ancients meant no other than <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of the Greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and whoſe Metropolis might therefore very well be dignified with the Name of the Metropolis of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Empire. 'Tis true, <hi>Peter</hi> makes no mention of <hi>Paul</hi> therein, becauſe he was not then at <hi>Rome:</hi> The time when it was written cannot be aſſign'd. See <hi>Lud. Cappellus,</hi> in his <hi>Appendix to the Apoſtolical Hiſtory;</hi> where, however, he enclines to the contrary Opinion. The ſame Author has furniſh'd us with an Hiſtory of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Travels, and the time when he wrote each of his Epiſtles: which Argument is alſo moſt accurately handled by Dr. <hi>Pearſon,</hi> in his <hi>Annales Paulini,</hi> and <hi>Praelectiones in Acta.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> alſo, the ſame year, made a Law concerning Deaconeſſes, and Women conſecrated to God, That they ſhould give nothing to the Churches.

A Decree of the ſame Emperor had a like ſucceſs, wherein it was Enacted, That Monks ſhould not enter into Cities, but dwell in ſolitary Places.

                  <hi>Medinath ol Nabi,</hi> the Juriſdiction of the Prophet; from this year it is that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> begin their <hi>Aera,</hi> which they called by the name of <hi>Hegira,</hi> i. e. <hi>flight:</hi> It's ſaid, <hi>Mahomet</hi> was at firſt a Keeper of Camels, but that afterwards by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with a certain Monk, whoſe name was <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> who was a follower of <hi>Manetes</hi>'s Phantaſtical Opinion, he became well inſtructed in the Notion of Predeſtination, for which the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are great Sticklers, and for thoſe who thought Chriſt himſelf had not Suffer'd, but that a Phantaſm was ſubſtituted in his room, which is believed by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>'s Followers to this day. From hence it was that the Crafty Man had an itching deſire to erect a new Sect in the World, whereof himſelf was Head; wherefore having Married his Miſtreſs, whom he had ſerved in looking after her Camels; he took this occaſion to act the Part of a Prophet: He was taken with the Falling-Sickneſs, which he pretended to have come upon him, when <hi>Michael</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:55008:91"/>the Archangel revealed any thing to him. <hi>Sergius</hi> confirmed the Fiction; and ſeeing there had been innumerable Diviſions and Janglings among the Chriſtians, and were ſtill in being concerning the Holy Trinity, they deemed it a ſafer Way to aſſert but one Divine Perſon and Nature, that all occaſion of Strife might be taken away, than to embrace any one of the Opinions in Controverſie; he alſo forbad the Drinking of Wine, as if he had received the ſame in Command from God; but in reality it was becauſe he had learnt it of <hi>Sergius</hi> the <hi>Manichaean,</hi> for thoſe Sects thought it a Duty to abſtain from Wine. Some have ſaid that <hi>Sergius</hi> was before a <hi>Jew,</hi> and that therefore he retained ſomething of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> which is not unlikely; for beſides the Tenents already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to be held by the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> theſe that follow ſavour of <hi>Judaiſm:</hi> It's not lawful for them to Eat Blood, Swine's-Fleſh, any Creature that died of it ſelf, any thing Sacrificed to Idols, Strangled, any Animal killed with a Stick, any thing caſt out, gored with an Horn, or ſtung by a Viper. Polygamy is tolerated, and Divorce not forbidden: They alſo Circumciſe as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; but whether <hi>Mahomet</hi> inſtituted the ſame, or that the ſaid Ceremony is now in uſe among the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> is a queſtion. However this may ſeem to be commendable in the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that they do not Arbitrarily adjudge all Mankind to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell; as appears from theſe words of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Alcoran. <hi>Surat.</hi> II.
